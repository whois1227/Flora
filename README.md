# Flora

Flora is an app orientated to education purposes of the IES Zaidin Vergeles in Spain. 

The app is made in Spanish to help the students in the learning process.

In the app, you add different plants and register differents fields about them, like their habitat, name, and other stuff

Now, talking technically about the app, It has the following characteristics:
- The MVVM archiquecture using an API REST to obtain the data. 
- I used the library Retrofit as a REST Client.
- It is based on fragments 
- Added the support of multiselection delete with recyclerview-selection google's library. 
- Dark mode, and intuitive usability.
