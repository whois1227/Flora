# Flora

Flora is an app orientated to education purposes of the IES Zaidin Vergeles in Spain. 

The app is made in Spanish to help the students in the learning process.

In the app, you add different plants and register differents fields about them, like their habitat, name, and other stuff

Now, talking technically about the app, It is based on the MVVM archiquecture, using an API REST to obtain the data. I used the library Retrofit as a REST Client.
Also is based on fragments and I added the support of multiselection delete with recyclerview-selection google's library. In addition, It has dark mode, and intuitive usability.
